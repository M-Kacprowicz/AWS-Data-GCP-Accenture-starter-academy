# **AWS-Data-GCP-Accenture-starter-academy**
*3 week academy during which I've learned how to use a few modules in AWS and GCP*

This repository doesn't include everything I've done. Final project was made on one of the team members AWS account on which we were working, but I didn't have a possibility to connect git to that account.

Presentation of final project is pushed to repository.
